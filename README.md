# COVID-19 Smartphone Detection


## Why is this Important?
Covid-19 is a global pandemic that puts millions of lives at risk everyday. Hospitals are becoming over-crowded, testing sites are breeding grounds for infection, and tests are not universally available. 

## What we are Doing!
We are developing artificial intelligence algorithms, which can be used to determine COVID-19 risk status from auditory and visual data captured from anyone’s smartphone.
