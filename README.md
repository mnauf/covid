## Vision
A tiny virus has brought society to a halt, while teaching us that we need to forget about fame and fortune and instead unite as a species globally!

Our vision is to develop a smartphone app that can be used by everyone in the world to find out in minutes whether they have COVID-19. We are utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to identify patterns undetectable by humans from the unique respiratory signatures of lungs damaged by the virus. From extensive research, we believe we can achieve 90% or more accuracy and bring an end to this pandemic!
